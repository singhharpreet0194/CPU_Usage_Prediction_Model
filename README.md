# Linear Regression Project: System Activity Analysis

## Introduction

🖥️ The comp-activ database contains a collection of computer system activity measures. Data was collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory in a multi-user university department. The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model to predict the 'usr' metric, which represents the portion of time (%) that CPUs run in user mode. Additionally, we aim to understand how each attribute affects the system's behavior in 'usr' mode using a list of system attributes.

## Dataset

📊 The dataset 'compactiv.xlsx' contains various system measures, each providing insights into the behavior of the computer system. These measures range from memory transfers to system calls and page requests. The 'usr' metric is our target variable, representing the percentage of time CPUs spend in user mode.
